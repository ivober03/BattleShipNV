# BattleShipNV 

## Description: 

**BattleShipNV** is an implementation of the classic Battleship game. Featuring an intelligent AI opponent, this project delivers a strategic gaming experience with a unique aesthetic and an original soundtrack, setting it apart from the traditional Battleship game.

## AI Methodology

The AI opponent employs a strategy that combines two modes: **Hunt** and **Target**. 

### Hunt Mode

The AI begins in **Hunt** mode, where it randomly selects coordinates to fire at. This random selection is not entirely arbitrary; it's guided by heuristics that help the AI make informed choices. This mode continues until the AI successfully hits an enemy ship.

### Target Mode

After a successful hit, the AI switches to **Target** mode. In this mode, the AI's objective is to systematically eliminate the enemy ship it initially hit.

#### Target Selection

In **Target** mode, the AI maintains a stack of 'potential' target cells. At first these potential target cells are determined based on the cells surrounding the initial hit. The AI prioritizes these cells based on their heuristic values.

The AI selects the cell from the stack with the highest heuristic value as its next target. 

#### Ship Orientation

Once the AI makes another hit, it gains knowledge about the orientation of the enemy ship. Specifically, it can determine whether the ship is placed horizontally or vertically.

#### Target Refinement

With knowledge of the ship's orientation, the AI updates its stack of potential targets to only include cells that match the determined orientation.

#### Backup Stack

To prepare for situations where the first two hit cells may not belong to the same ship, the AI maintains a backup stack of the original potential cells.

*The AI ​​returns to hunt mode only once the ship being targeted has sunk.*

## AI Optimization: 

### Parity: 

Because the smallest ship is at least two units long, we don't need to search every corner of the board randomly. Even the shortest ship needs to cover two neighboring squares.



We can tell our **Hunt** strategy to only shoot randomly at unknown locations with even parity.

Once a target is hit and **Target** mode is turned on, the 'parity' rule no longer applies, allowing us to investigate all potential targets. If the algorithm switches back to **Hunt** mode, the parity filter is turned on again.

Once the two-units boat is sunk, we can modify the parity rule for a broader spacing. 

### Probability Density Functions: 

At the start of every new turn, based on the ships still left in the battle, we’ll work out all possible locations that every ship could fit (horizontally or vertically).

Initially, this will be pretty much anywhere, but as more and more shots are fired, some locations become less likely, and some impossible. Every time it’s possible for a ship to be placed in over a grid location, we’ll increment a counter for that cell. The result will be a superposition of probabilities

The concept of PDFs involves determining the likelihood of various events occurring, in this case, the potential positions of enemy ships on the game grid. This approach enables the AI to make informed guesses about the whereabouts of opponent ships and adapt its tactics accordingly.
